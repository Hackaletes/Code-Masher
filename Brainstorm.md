Top 5 Ideas:

This app allows users to have a full fledged fantasy football app to meet this requirement Market: This app is specified towards everyone who uses fantasy football and need a convienient way of keeping track of their league. Habit: Users would use this app every week during the football season to keep track of their points and make trades throughout the season. Scope: It will be challenging to incorporate the API, but other than that and the animations of the app, it seems like a very helpful and fun app. This is a very good app whether it is stripped down or not. There are many features that can be added to make our app more unique.
Hangman Description: User plays hangman the game by guessing letters in a hidden word. This game has a easy, medium, and hard level, each with increasing word difficulties. Easy with one person, medium with two people, and hard with three. The user has until all of the men are gone until the game is over.

Habit: This app could be used on the daily or occasionally, it is really up to the user preference and has no real Scope: This app is very obtainable in the amount of time we do have to finish it. When stripped down I think this app is kind of dull, but with some more feature we think of as we go it could be something more innovative.
Paper Toss Description: User has a paper ball in their possession and has to swipe the screen in the right angle in order to make the paper ball into the bin you are aiming at.

Market: This app is marketed towards any group or age, but more specifically towards kids as most of the have touch screen phones nowadays. Habit: This app would be used based on the users as they could play it a lot one day when they have nothing to do, but not play it as much another day due to being busy. Scope: This app is obtainable in our alotted time. Even when stripped down it would still be a pretty good app idea in our eyes. We have some potential plans of adding differnt things like animations, points, and some other things
Code Mashers Description: App is an idle clicker game with enemies that user taps and defeats after depleting health bar, then a new enemy spawns.

Whatever the user decides Scope: This game is obtainable depending on how many features we intend to add, but stripped down, it is a very intersting idea. We have fleshed out a lot of the ideas for this app as it is our top pick so far
Word RPG Description: User goes through a story based read where they are able to make their own decisions at certain points in the story. Each decision has its own consequences and it lets the users choose their own endign Category: Entertainment Story: You are sitting at home looking to play a story game that is not too long but will fullfill your satisfaction.
